And it's Donna, by the way, Donna Noble, since you didn't ask. I'll have a salute. 
Everybody knows that everybody dies and nobody knows it like The Doctor. But I do think that all the skies in all the worlds would turn dark if he ever, for one moment, accepts it. 
The entire planet is hurtling around the sun at sixty-seven thousand miles an hour. And I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world. And, if we let goâ€¦.That's who I am. Now forget me, Rose Tyler. Go home.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door, and believe me, they've tried! Now shut up a minute!

Agatha Christie! I was just talking about you the other day! I said 'I bet she's brilliant!' I'm the Doctor, this is Donna. Oh, I love your stuff! What a mind! You fool me every time! Well... almost every time. Well... once or twice... Well... once. But it was a good once! 
Well, she was British and moneyed. They carry on, except for this one time. Nobody know what happened. She just vanished. Her car will be found tomorrow morning by the side of a lake. Ten days later, Agatha Christie turns up in a hotel in Harrogate.
